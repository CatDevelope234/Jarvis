# Jarvis
I have told you how to create A PERSONAL ASSISTANT(JARVIS) HERE.
This is the simple code of about 450 lines for a personal assistant that I made.
I have imported some modules here so you have to install these.
This project is not based on any ML algorithm and is only for beginners who want to build something innovative.
I want to attract people towards the powerful programming language python. This is a innovative project and I am sure people will start learning python by seeing this.
So be sure to test out the codeðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜ƒ.
I am sure you will be able to build your own personal assistant too so Happy coding!!
